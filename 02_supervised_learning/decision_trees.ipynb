The recursive partitioning of the data is repeated until each region in the partition (each leaf in the decision tree) only contrains a single target value (single class or a single regression value). A leafe of the tree that contains data points that all share the same target value is called *pure*. The output of a test data point, is the traversal of the decision tree until it reaches a leaf and then predicts the majority (or mean, in the case of regression) target."

    "Continuing building a tree until it has all *pure* leaves leads to a very complex and highly overfit model. Outliers can lead to uninformative decision boundary. There are two common strategies to prevent overfitting: pre-prunning and post-pruning (or just pruning). Pre-prunning my include limiting the maximum depth of the tree, limiting the maximum number of leaves, or requiring a minimum number of points in a node to keep splitting. Sckit-learn only implements pre-pruning, not post-pruning.\n"
